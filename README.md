# Two Mixed Bags: Web Mapping Projects and Their Developers

A talk for the 2021 MN GIS/LIS Consortium annual conference, October 27â€“29.

## Abstract

Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), no-code web mapping solutions (e.g., Esri web
maps, templates, and Web AppBuilder; Google Maps, CARTO, etc.) meet many needs,
but what happens when you can't meet requirements using one of these solutions?
Now, you're a web developer.

With a growing staff and regular turnover of our graduate research assistants,
who often join us with no web development experience, U-Spatial (pop. ~15)
needed an approach that supports staff who are entirely new to web development,
ensures some degree of consistency both within and across projects, enables
cleaner collaboration, doesn't hinder more advanced projects, requires little
effort to maintain, and isn't onerous. And, no one in our group is a
most-of-the-time web developer, let alone a full-time one. Did we make it? Over
a year since we began, this talk will describe our current approach, including
the technologies and tools we use, how we got there, and where we're going.
